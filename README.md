Here is my code for the famous "finding the closest pair of points" problem from CLRS book section 33.4 using a divide-and-conquer approach (this code returns the minimum distance between pair of points).

This code works correctly but it's slow. As seen in the code, I pre-sort so I avoid sorting at every recursive call, however, my run time is still too long.

Please help me speed this code up; other suggestions about this code is also much appreciated as I am a novice Python enthusiast.
